# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The aim of the project is to clean and extract usable data from the above zip file. R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Assumptions:
Data required for the project already downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
and exist in working directory

In this project, you will find:

    run_analysis.R : the R code to run on the data set

    TidyData.txt : the clean data extracted from the original data using run_analysis.R

    CodeBook.md : the CodeBook reference to the variables in TidyData.txt

    README.md : the analysis of the code in run_analysis
